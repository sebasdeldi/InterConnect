        Upload the SLI document provided by your shipper.
        <br>
        <br>
        An SLI is an optional document that conveys specific instructions from exporters to their agents (usually freight forwarders) for ocean and air shipments. Think of it as a letter that tells your agent/forwarder how and where they need to send your products. Itâ€™s purpose is three-fold:
        <br>
        <br>
		    - To provide transportation and documentation instructions;
		    <br>
		    <br>
		    - To provide export control and reporting information;
		    <br>
		    <br>
		    - To convey authorization to the agent to transmit Electronic Export Information (EEI) to the Automated Export System (AES).
